**Learn about our research**
============================

We are passionate about tackling the latest challenges in the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the life sciences. Enjoy this overview of our research objectives.

**Unsupervised / Semi-supervised / Self-supervised learning**  
**Challenge:** to tackle the lack of training data  
In medical imaging, and the classification of either cell types or diseases, there is
no ground truth, and labelling data are sparse. This is a unique challenge in biological
applications compared to other areas in AI research.

**Explainability and uncertainty quantification**  
**Challenge:** the need for insights into models beyond (average) predictive performance  
We aim to derive causal and/or mechanistic insights and quantify model uncertainty.

**Privacy aware and federated learning**  
**Challenge:** to preserve privacy while allowing aggregation of information  
The ability to deploy AI to relevant problems is linked to the volume of data that can be
leveraged for training. This demands federated algorithms and infrastructures that preserve
privacy while allowing to aggregate information across different computing centers and
country borders.

**Sparse predictions from dense inputs**  
**Challenge:** creating sparse summaries of terapixel data sets  
Modern imaging yields terapixel data sets, but downstream analytics often require structured,
sparse summaries of this data. Current deep learning methods are not able to yield such
structured estimates.

**Interpretable low-dimensional representations and metric learning**  
**Challenge:** dimensionality reduction and analysis of interrelations  
Complex multimodal high-dimensional data (e.g., single-cell multi-omics) require methods for
dimensionality reduction and analysis of interrelations, from clusters/classes to continuous
gradients to graphs or lineage trees.

**Validation and Benchmarking for clinical translation**  
**Challenge:** validation and benchmarking of algorithms for specific biomedical projects  
Commonly used machine learning metrics and validation strategies often fail to address aspects
that are crucial to the application domain and do not allow for tailoring of future research
strategies to domain-specific needs.
